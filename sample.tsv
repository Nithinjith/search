//www.maptiler.com/how-to/3d-online-globe/	Create a 3d online globe	Create a 3d online globeA tutorial, how to create a 3d online globe and visualise in WebGLEarth.The easiest way to create an online 3d globe from an image is to prepare the texture of the whole world with a size ratio 2:1, since there is 360 to 180 degrees. Such texture can be downloaded from a David Rusey’s website: http://www.davidrumsey.com/blog/2009/9/7/cassini-terrestrial-and-celestial-globes-1790First, open the MapTiler, choose Mercator tiles and drag and drop the image inside. Confirm the suggested projection and choose bounding box. You can directly confirm the bounding box values, as the area covers the whole world. Click on continue, choose MBTiles or folder, type the name and start rendering. The next step is to upload the created map to any hosting, in the video tutorial is used the Amazon S3, but you can use a standard webhosting with tileserver php application.After rendering, go to your tileserver and choose the globe. Then, click on preview in WebGLEarth. The online globe is fully covered with the prepared texture. Its now possible to turn, zoom, pan and simply play with the Globe according to your wish. You can also copy and paste the source code into your website and the globe runs without any plugins directly in html5.	how-to	en	2016-05-14T13:50:10+02:00	globe,online,old map,3D,Map processing

Tile formatThe produced tiles can be saved in one of several image format. MapTiler includes optimization of the final filesize and used number of colors (quantization), to minimize the disk size occupied by the rendered maps as well as the time necessary to transfer the maps to clients once the tiles are online.Formats with support for transparency are:  png 8a which is DEFAULT. Paletted RGBA PNG image  png 32-bitNon-transparent formats are:  Progressive JPEG image in the YCbCr color space  Paletted RGB PNG image  24-bit RGB PNG imageResampling methodsThe visual quality of the output tiles is also defined by the resampling method. Selected method is used for interpolation of the values of individual pixels and it affects the sharpness vs smoothness of the produced maps.  DEFAULT. Bilinear resampling (2x2 pixel kernel)  Nearest neighbor resampling. Rarely makes sense for production data. Can be useful for quick testing, since it is much faster the the others.  Cubic convolution approximation (4x4 pixel kernel).  Cubic B-Spline Approximation (4x4 pixel kernel).  Average computes the average of all non-NODATA contributing pixels. (GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0)  Mode resampling, selects the value which appears most often of all the sampled points. (GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0)Transparency settingsThis option is typically used to eliminate borders of multiple map sheets that are stitched together.

//www.maptiler.com/how-to/coordinate-systems/	Coordinate systems	Coordinate systemsEach map, that should be properly overlaid needs to have defined coordinate system (or Spatial reference system, which is just other name). There are thousands coordinate systems, from which the most commonly used is WGS84. The geodata from a national geospatial agencies usually come in the local coordinate system, like for example Ordnance Survey from the United Kingdom, where the system is EPSG:27700.The dialog for choosing of a coordinate system pops up right after upload of the source file. MapTiler automatically loads the coordinate system, unfortunately in some geodata it is not included. Then, you have to load it from external file, or specify it manually. Load SRS from fileTo load the SRS from file, click on the appropriate button and assign the file. Typically used extensions are: .prj, .srs, .txt. Then, click on the “set” button and continue with adding the Georeference.Search for SRS manuallyYou can search for a country, code of the coordinate system, or its name. For instance, write UK to get the coordinate systems used in the area of the United Kingdom. Also other keywords such as Britain or Ordnance survey will guide you to choose the right coordinate system for your map. For each coordinate system there is also a list of accuracies, which you find after clicking on the little arrow next to the coordinate system name.After you find the right coordinate system of your map, click on the set button. If you are not sure, which coordinate system to use, skip this step and find more information at the provider of your map data. By clicking on the “change” button you can always come back and do a change.MapTiler supports over 6 thousand of coordinate systems from all over the world and loads the EPSG.io database.Define own Coordinate system1) Go to epsg-registry.org2) Search for Clarke 18803) Choose the suitable result and click on WKT4) Paste the definition into MapTiler as a custom projection	how-to	en	2016-04-16T13:50:10+02:00	coordinate systems,srs,crs,epsg,projection,Map processing

//www.maptiler.com/how-to/drupal/	MapTiler and OpenLayers in Drupal CMS	Map and OpenLayers for Drupal CMSThis is a quick how-to for making a tile overlay for maps displayed in a Drupal 7 website. You will need to set up a Drupal 7 site and load a number of modules. If you dont know the Drupal CMS, take a look at their website to get started: www.drupal.org The basic principles are listed at www.drupal.org/start and there are tutorials online and on YouTube as well. Drupal is free to use and good for powerful websites without necessarily needing any programming (though you can if you can).The modules you’ll need are:      Views -&gt; enable Views and Views UIwww.drupal.org/project/views        Chaos Tools -&gt; enable ChaosToolswww.drupal.org/project/ctools        Libraries -&gt; enable Libraries (under ‘Other’)www.drupal.org/project/libraries        Proj4JS -&gt; enable Proj4JS (under ‘Other’)www.drupal.org/project/proj4js        geoPHP -&gt; enable geoPHP (under ‘Other’)www.drupal.org/project/geophp        OpenLayers -&gt; enable OpenLayers, OpenLayers UI - and OpenLayers Viewswww.drupal.org/project/openlayers  For OpenLayers you’ll also need the geoPHP library. Download from https://github.com/phayes/geoPHP, unpack the archive file, rename the unpacked folder to ‘geophp’ and place it in the sites/all/libraries folder of your Drupal installation - you may have to create the ‘libraries’ folder if it’s not there.(At time of writing the OpenLayers v3 module is still under development,so we’re using v2 which works fine for tile overlays.)1. Prepare your map with MapTilerYou will of course need a map image of some sort, but again, if you’re reading this then I’ll take it you’ll have that part of the work sorted out already. In my case, I’ve used an A0 scanner to scan paper maps, which I’ve straightened and sharpened a bit in Photoshop before removing the borders and saving them as web-ready (but still 300dpi) png files.To get a quick idea, how to [Georeference] (/how-to/georeferencing/) and save your map follow this tutorial: Don’t forget to save your tiles into Folder. Use one word for its name, no spaces or special characters.Also included is a json file used by certain mapping applications, and four html files showing what your overlay looks like in four different mapping engines. If you were ma- king a website in simple html you could just copy the code from one of these files into a page, add the tile folder in the same directory as your page and it would all work.2. HostingThe next step is to upload the tileset to a server to provide a web address. I’m still tes- ting with a Drupal installation on Dropbox, and putting the tileset there works fine as well.On a webserver you can create a directory for your tilesets, much like the ‘images’ di- rectory where you store your website’s pictures. All that matters is that you can supply a URL path to the directory that houses your tilesets to use in OpenLayers in Drupal.The reason for this is the brilliantly simple way I found of accessing tilesets, after spen- ding a couple of days trying to make the others work. I’m no cartographer or program- mer, and I couldn’t figure out where to find the data (in the right format) required by various other overlay types. Since Klokan are experts in this field, I sent them an email to see if they could help. I was honoured to receive a reply from company founder Petr Pridal himself, who suggested using an XYZ address as a possibility, together with a code sample. My next piece of luck was misclicking on a link in OpenLayers to discover that the tiles for the OSM Mapnik base map are handled by an XYZ overlay type as well. Which then turned out to be simplicity itself. Here’s how an XYZ address works:To test in Dropbox it works much the same, except the first part. I have everything sit- ting in my “local” folder (same level as “private“, “public” etc), which is addressed by “dropbox.local” before the rest of the folder path (see screendump on previous page).http://dropbox.local/maptest_tiles/chateauneuf_tiles/${z}/${x}/${y}.png(this is why there shouldn’t be any spaces in the folder names.)3. OpenLayers in Drupal 7And now we’ll make the overlay with our tiles and put it on an OpenLayers map to dis- play in a view. For testing purposes I’ve used an out-of-the-box Drupal 7 setup with just the modules I’ve listed before (I’ll turn it into something nice when I know it’ll all work!).In your ‘Administration’ menu, you’ll find ‘Open- Layers’ under ‘Structure’.Click the ‘Layers tab’ and then ‘+ Add’.Give your layer a title and maybe a description.Under ‘LayerType’, select ‘XYZ’ from the dropdown.You’ll see there’s also a ‘MapTiler’ type in this list, but I read that the OpenLayers module developers will re- move the ‘MapTiler’ type and have already included it with the ‘WMS’ type (apparently they’re similar).MapTiler tilesets work with WMS and WMTS but these are pretty complicated to set up (just take a look!). XYZ is far simpler.After selecting ‘XYZ’ , more options appear.The important one is the ‘base URL’.This is where we tell OpenLayers where to find the tileset. Everything else we can leave for now, just scroll down and click ‘save’. And that’s all it takes to make the overlay. You’ll find it included in the list of overlays after saving.Next: setting up the map.Go back to ‘Administration &gt; Structure &gt; OpenLayers’, click the ‘Maps’ tab and ‘+ Add’. Under ‘Infos’, provide a title and maybe a description for your map. Leave ‘Width’ set to ‘auto’, adjust ‘Height’ to 500px (f ex) to have a bit more display space.Under ‘Center &amp; Bounds’, you’ll see a mapZoom and pan to show the area your overlay will fit over.You’ll have to use the controls on the map to do this, dragging with a mouse doesn’t seem to work.Hold down your shift key, and drag a rectangle over the map that’s a bit larger than where your overlay map will be.The first action specifies the map area to be shown on the page (you’ll see the coordi- nates and zoom level indicated on the page below the map). Doing this means your visi- tors will see your overlay straightaway instead of having to find it by zooming in them- selves from the world view.The orange area is the area beyond which you can prevent viewers to scroll the map away, if that’s what you want. Lower down the settings on this page there’s a ‘Restrict Extent’ checkbox (already checked) that does this. Up to you.Next, under ‘Layers &amp; Styles’, your Map Projection should already be set to EPSG:3857Further down, the Display Projection should already be set to EPSG:4326Further down again, enable the ‘OSM Mapnik’ base map and make it the default map. (You can always enable more of the others later to try them out on your page view.)And finally, further down again, enable and activate your overview layer. In fact you can enable more than one layer (just like you could enable more than one base map in the previous step). If you also check ‘in switcher’, you will allow your visitors to choose which overview they want to see.The choice of base maps you enable is always in the switcher.(The ‘weight’ setting controls the layer order - the higher the number, the lower down a layer will be in the stack.)And that’s the basic map set up.There are more options you could try out, though quite a few of those will only work for vector layers. For now be sure to scroll down and save!Next, the final part: setting up a view page to display the map.Go to ‘Adminstration &gt; Structure &gt; Views’ and click on ‘+ Add new view’Give your new view a title (this will be shown on the page). ‘Create a page’ is already checked. Under ‘Display for- mat’ choose ‘Open- Layers Map’ from the dropdown menu. Uncheck ‘Use a pager’. Click ‘Continue &amp; edit’ at the bottom of this page.On the next screen, you only need to do two things: Under ‘Format’, click ‘Settings’. In the pop-up, select your map from the dropdown menu and click ‘Apply (all displays)’.Under ‘Page settings’, click ‘No menu’. In the pop-up, select ‘Normal menu entry’, type in a title, select ‘main menu’ from the dropdown and click ‘Apply’. After that, click ‘Save’ at top right. And then ‘View Page’ a bit lower at right.And there you should have your map with your overlay sitting on a page! The little black control at top right is the switcher mentioned before.(If at this point you don’t see your overlay, try zooming in more to where it’s supposed to be, and/or clear Drupal’s caches under ‘Administration &gt; Development &gt; Performance‘.)That’s the principle of the thing , so now we can start fiddling with the settings to experiment and fine-tune. Everything we’ve seen in Drupal is editable.

//www.maptiler.com/how-to/folder-mbtiles/	Folder vs. MBTiles	Folder vs. MBTilesOne step before the rendering, it is possible to decide, whether you want to save your maps as Folder or as an MBTiles file. Folder contains a structure different tiles sorted to directories according to the zoom levels. To load folder on the hosting server takes longer, but the response on the website is then faster.MBTiles is a single file, that can be easily loaded on any hosting and the upload time is shorter. However, the reponse for the users of your website is a bit slower then for the Folder structures. MBTiles are also suitable for imports of the maps into mobile devices.Recommendation: If you render smaller maps or maps for your mobile device, use MBTiles. For larger maps and requirements for a fast access from end users, render into Folder and use a stable and fast hosting solution.	how-to	en	2016-03-16T13:50:10+02:00	folder,mbtiles

//www.maptiler.com/how-to/georeferencing/	Position of the map (Georeferencing)	Position of the map - GeoreferencingWhat is the difference between pictures and map is the information about its geographical position. Therefore, to create maps, it is necessary to define a coordinate system and its geographical position. MapTiler automatically loads the geographical position system, in case it is known. If not, you will have to assign it manually. The dialog for assigning of a geograhphical position pops up right after setting of the Coordinate system. There are several ways, how to do it:Assign Location Visually (Georeferencer)For pictures that are missing Geographical information, the easiest way how to get it is to assign the control points. Click on the button “Assign Location Visually” and you will get to the screen with 2 maps. You you need to do is to assign control points on the same places on both maps. Minimum number of control points is 3, however, the more control points you assign, the more precise the result will be. The whole process is illustrated on this tutorial:Load from external fileMany maps have their position saved in the the external files. Usually, these are with extensions .wld, .tfw, .jgw, .pgw, .gfw, or exported from GIS software such as OziExplorer or MapInfo (extensions .map, .tab). If you have such file, just click on the import button, choose the file, confirm, and the Georeference will be loaded.Specify Bounding BoxFor maps with orientation to North, it is possible to specify the Bounding Box, which is a rectangle, that creates a border of the map itself. The Bounding Box has to be specified in this order: West, South, East, North. In this case, the values -180 -90 180 90 cover the whole world. Assigning a position via bounding box is illustrated on the following tutorial:GeotransformationTo assign affine transformation directly, you can specify a world file as 6 numbers.ChangeIn case you are not sure about the Georeference, or you map is not positioned correctly, you can always come back and assign the geographical position again by clicking on the “change” button.	how-to	en	2016-05-16T00:50:10+02:00

//www.maptiler.com/how-to/merge-mbtiles/	Merging MBTiles	Merging MBTilesThis feature is in PRO version only.MapTiler can easily merge different maps in MBTiles format. It is also possible to replace a part of one MBTiles with another MBtiles. This feature is quite useful and saves a lot of rendering timein case you receive a new update of source data and you need to replace just fewzoom levels with this new part.Process of mergingMerging utility is available after every rendering of MBTiles or when you openmbtiles file in MapTiler. When you close a preview, in the bottom part of the window you can find 4 buttons. The last one (Merge) will open the merging utility.The tool has 2 options that affect time of merging and quality of theimage. “Start merging” button opens a dialog to choose second file. IMPORTANT information is, that the CHOSEN file ALWAYS REPLACES tiles in CURRENT opened file.In case, there are different zoom levels in different layers, then the result will have zoom levels fromboth files.The following example shows the whole world of Blue Marble image in spring(left image) which is merged with a half of Blue Marble winter image. In this case, spring image has to be opened in MapTiler and winter image added via the “Start merging” option.There are 2 additional options available:sparse - Fills the empty space between separate maps (if there is some) with empty tiles in background colour. This option can take longer to render, if there are huge areas between maps, as these have to be created. In case the maps overlap each other, there is no extra action involved.reencode - This option is useful, when the 2 merged maps have different format (e.g. jpeg and png). By default, the result is a hybrid format (combination of both of them).  If reencode option is used, the chosen file is encoded to the actual format (which can slow down the process).	how-to	en	2016-05-16T13:50:10+02:00

//www.maptiler.com/how-to/speed/	Speed	 SpeedMapTiler is a multi-threaded program. The modern CPUs has multiple cores and support of Hyperthreading - which provides multiple logical CPUs per core. This way MapTiler can provide higher performance even on a dual-core computer. The free version is limited to 1 CPU, MapTiler Start and Plus have a limit of 2 CPUs for rendering, which doubles the rendering speed. For the Pro versions, according to the version it will use all the available CPUs. With such power, it is easily able to render extremely large datasets (e.g. continents or the whole world). The number of purchased CPUs is automatically detected and if the computer is capable of faster rendering, it is possible to purchase additional CPUs for higher rendering speed.![mbtiles](/how-to/media/cpu_1.png)	how-to	en	2016-05-16T13:50:10+02:00
